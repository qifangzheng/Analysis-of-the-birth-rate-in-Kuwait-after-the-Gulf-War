# Analysis-of-the-birth-rate-in-Kuwait-after-the-Gulf-War
This study is looking at the factors that could influence the birth rate between 1991 and 2017 in Kuwait, after Gulf War. After Feb,
1991, Kuwait was liberated. Kuwait spent more than 5 billion to repair oil infrastruc-ture damaged during the Gulf war. In this study, I am particularly interested in how the economy recovery resulting in GDP and female employment rate, thus in turn influenced birth rate.
The dependent variable is the birth rate. The indepedant variables include female employment rate, GDP, urban population growth, and military expenditure during the same period in Kuwait.

This is a Udacity project to analyze a dataset of my choice.  I chose five datasets containing social demographic data of Kuwait after the Gulf War. 
 - child per woman total fertility
 - femals aged 15 24 employment rate
 - military expenditure percent of gdp
 - urban population growth annual percent
 - income per person
